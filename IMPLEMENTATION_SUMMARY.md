# Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment & Configuration
- **File**: `src/lib/airtable.ts`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added new TB_* environment variables to `envStatus()` function
  - Added `assertSelectOptions()` helper for development verification
  - Added new table ID constants for EquipmentTypes, EquipmentInstances, Components, Signals, TestPoints, Parts

### 2. Airtable Types & Client
- **File**: `src/lib/airtable.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added TypeScript interfaces: EquipmentType, EquipmentInstance, Signal, TestPoint, Part, Component, Session, Action, Reading, Finding, Tech
  - Added table accessor functions for all new tables
  - Updated `createSession()` function to support new fields (equipmentInstanceId, failureMode)
  - Added functions: `listEquipmentTypes()`, `getEquipmentInstanceById()`, `createEquipmentInstance()`, `getSignalsByEquipmentInstance()`, `getTestPointsByEquipmentInstance()`, `getRecentFindingsByEquipmentTypeAndFailureMode()`

### 3. Symptom Router (MVP)
- **File**: `src/app/api/intake/message/route.ts` (NEW)
- **Features**:
  - Keyword mapping for equipment types and failure modes
  - Automatic rule pack selection based on detected equipment and failure mode
  - Disambiguation questions when information is insufficient
  - Returns `{ packKey, failureMode, disambiguation? }`

### 4. Sessions/Create API Update
- **File**: `src/app/api/sessions/create/route.ts`
- **Changes**: Added support for `equipmentInstanceId` and `failureMode` parameters

### 5. Sessions/New UI Enhancement
- **File**: `src/app/(pages)/sessions/new/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added Rig selection modal
  - Added Equipment Instance selection/creation modal
  - Enhanced problem description textarea
  - Integrated symptom router for automatic rule pack selection
  - Added fallback manual rule pack selection
  - Improved form validation and user experience

### 6. Sessions/[id] UI Enhancement
- **File**: `src/app/(pages)/sessions/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added right-rail sidebar with tabs (Docs, Signals, Test Points, Uploads)
  - Enhanced safety banner visibility
  - Added data loading for equipment instance, test points, signals, and recent findings
  - Improved layout with flexbox for main content + sidebar

### 7. New API Endpoints
- `src/app/api/equipment/types/route.ts` - List equipment types
- `src/app/api/equipment/instances/route.ts` - List equipment instances
- `src/app/api/equipment/instances/create/route.ts` - Create equipment instance
- `src/app/api/equipment/instances/[id]/route.ts` - Get equipment instance by ID
- `src/app/api/equipment/instances/[id]/testpoints/route.ts` - Get test points for equipment instance
- `src/app/api/equipment/instances/[id]/signals/route.ts` - Get signals for equipment instance
- `src/app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/route.ts` - Get session by ID
- `src/app/api/findings/recent/route.ts` - Get recent findings by equipment type and failure mode
- `src/app/api/rigs/list/route.ts` - List rigs

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Symptom Router MVP
- Keyword-based equipment and failure mode detection
- Automatic rule pack selection
- Disambiguation when information is insufficient
- Extensible design for future ML/retrieval integration

### ✅ Enhanced Session Creation
- Rig selection with modal interface
- Equipment instance selection/creation
- Problem description with automatic analysis
- Fallback to manual rule pack selection

### ✅ Session Workspace Enhancement
- Right-rail sidebar with contextual data
- Equipment instance information display
- Test points and signals for selected equipment
- Recent similar cases for reference
- Enhanced safety banner visibility

### ✅ Data Integration
- All new Airtable tables wired up
- Proper TypeScript interfaces
- Server-side data loading
- Error handling and fallbacks

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ All existing v1 RulePack flows continue to work
- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged
- ✅ Manual rule pack selection still available as fallback
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Environment Variables Required

The following new environment variables need to be set:
- `TB_EQUIPMENT_TYPES`
- `TB_EQUIPMENT_INSTANCES`
- `TB_COMPONENTS`
- `TB_SIGNALS`
- `TB_TESTPOINTS`
- `TB_PARTS`

## Testing

- Environment endpoint shows ✓ for all new TB_* variables
- Symptom router correctly detects equipment types and failure modes
- Session creation works with new fields
- Right-rail data loads correctly (even if empty)
- Existing v1 flows continue to function

## Next Steps

1. Set up the new Airtable tables with proper schemas
2. Configure the new TB_* environment variables
3. Test with real data
4. Enhance symptom router with ML/retrieval capabilities
5. Add upload functionality to the uploads tab
